## Role

My role at N2Clic changed a lot over the years. At the beginning, I had my nose in the code. I was spending my days writing PHP, line after line.

Then things started to change. As time passed, I started to have a more business-oriented role in the company. Meeting with clients, defining projects specifications, drafting briefs, and more generally, developing the business.

> Over the course of the last couple months, both Julien L. and Julien V. were extremely responsive, solution oriented, attentive to our objectives and tirelessly worked to exceed our expectations.

While I still do write code (mostly for personal projects now), I enjoy very much working on the "bigger picture" and developing future-proof business strategies. The business side of things is what I enjoy doing, and it is what gets me up in the morning.

I take great pride in seeing the business growing, reaching its targets and creating sustainable business models. There is always more than one way to develop a business. The process of getting to know the ins and outs of a company and figure out which direction to take is extremely interesting and challenging.

## Work

During my time at N2Clic, I had the opportunity to work on a lot of different projects. Here are a couple of clients I worked with.

### Morphosis Apps
